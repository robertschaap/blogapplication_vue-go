# Title
A blog application where users can signup, post and read as well as comment on posts.

##### Technologies
HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | Vue | Go | Upper.io | Mongo DB

### Scope
##### What it was designed to do
+ Use REST routing with query parameters.
+ Implement an MVC type architecture in Go.

##### What it wasn't designed to do
- Updating/editing. This can be built in but the focus of the project was more on the routing and the actual posting/reading.

### Installation Notes
Please feel free to download or clone the repository. Please make sure you have Go installed. I haven't used Glide or Dep for package management so you may just need to go get Upper.io. Also make sure that you have MongoDB installed.
